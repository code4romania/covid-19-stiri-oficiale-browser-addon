Objective: Combating disinformation.

How:

- Platform which centralizes all the official press releases, press conferences and decisions of the Committee for Special Emergency Situations.
- Browser add-on which identifies in any web page key phrases and adds over them an info box which redirects towards official information sources.

Concept developed as part of the Civic Labs program of Code for Romania

[See the project live](https://stirioficiale.ro/)

This is a browser extension that helps identify key expressions related to COVID-19 (coronavirus) and adds an infobox that links to official sources of information. Highlightning official sources helps to diminish the effects of 'fake news'.
The concept is developed as part of the Civic Labs program of Code for Romania in partnership with the Authority for Romania's Digitalization.
